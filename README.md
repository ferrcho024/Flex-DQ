FlexDQ is a framework that guides users in selecting the most appropriate DQ dimensions based on their analytical goals and the context in which the data were acquired. A structured questionnaire facilitates this selection process, allowing users to confirm, modify, or extend the suggested dimensions, thereby preserving flexibility for context-aware DQ evaluation. The framework computes individual metrics for each selected dimension and integrates them into a comprehensive DQ Index. Crucially, the value of this index is tied to the dimensions selected
and, thus, acquires specific meaning according to the intended use of the data

A sample dataset is provided to facilitate testing of the proposed framework. This dataset includes a column that specifies whether each data point is artificial, enabling the calculation of the artificiality dimension. Additionally, the same dataset may serve as reference data for the evaluation of dimensions that require a ground truth, such as accuracy, concordance, and uncertainty.
